🌈 ColorLife Advanced – Multidimensional Game of Life with Color Logic
An experimental and modern take on Conway’s Game of Life, enhanced with interactive color mechanics, emergent behavior, and a theory-driven simulation engine inspired by Binary Pulse Theory.

Built for creativity, visualization, and logic experimentation, this web-based simulation pushes the boundaries of traditional cellular automata by introducing color as a functional dimension, not just a visual effect.

🔥 Project Highlights
Dynamic Color Automata
Cells aren’t just alive or dead — they carry color, blend with neighbors, and leave ghost trails when they die, preserving memory visually.

Binary Pulse Inspired Logic
Designed to test ideas from Binary Pulse Theory, where the base reality emerges from oscillation between 1 and 0 — now layered with visual harmonics and decay.

Interactive UI with Custom Controls
Users can tweak zoom, speed, color mode, ghost intensity, and more.

Save & Load Patterns (WIP)
Preset seeds and color states will be supported in JSON.

Mobile-Friendly, Lightweight, and Extensible
No frameworks or external dependencies. Easily embeddable or modifiable.

🎨 Features
🖱 Cell Painting & Erasing: Click or drag to create patterns with your selected color.

🌈 Color Logic:

New cells inherit an average color from their three live neighbors.

Dead cells become ghosts, fading to a lighter version of their final color.

Optionally, cells could interact more strongly when colors are complementary (e.g., red + green).

⚙️ Adjustable Simulation Parameters (via new control panel):

Cell size (Zoom)

Grid size (planned)

Simulation speed (FPS)

Color blending behavior

Ghost fade logic

📏 Multiple Neighbor Rules (planned): Moore, von Neumann, and Extended

🧬 Pattern Library (optional add-on):

100+ classic Game of Life patterns

Insert via searchable modal UI

🧪 No Color Decay (preserves state stability)

💾 Save & Load Support for future expansion

🧠 Extensible Color Theories:

Add harmonic, rhythmic, or frequency-based rules

Test color-as-frequency or waveform logic

🚀 How to Use
Clone or download the repository.

Open index.html in any modern browser.

Click/drag on the canvas to paint live cells with the selected color.

Click ▶ Start / ⏸ Pause to begin or stop the simulation.

Click ⇆ Forward to toggle between forward and reverse playback.

Adjust zoom, color, and speed as needed.

Cells evolve automatically with color blending and ghosting logic.

🧠 Binary Pulse Theory Integration
This project is the visual simulation branch of an evolving theoretical framework:

Binary Pulse Theory (BPT) posits that the foundation of all emergent complexity — from matter to consciousness — is a binary oscillation:
Existence (1) ↔ Nonexistence (0)
From this duality, rhythm, resonance, and color emerge — encoded here as living/dying cells with fading color memory.

🧩 Planned Features
🎚 Full Parameter Panel (on-page adjustable settings section)

📦 Save/Load JSON states

🖼 Pattern Picker Modal with Classic Patterns

🧠 "Pulse Mode" for binary-only rule toggles

🔊 Sound generation from color values (synthesis-based)
